# Python QOI (py-qoi)
[QOI (Quite OK Image format)](https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi) is a new lossless image format that achieves compression rates close to PNG with a 20x-50x faster encoding.

The idea here is (of course) not to beat the original implementation's performance since it's written in C. Rather, the main goal of this project is to implement it the "pythonic" way, with minimal dependencies. There's a [python wrapper](https://github.com/kodonnell/qoi) around the original C implementation.
